Information:
------------
First version of muon calibration package for full 2017 dataset
Data: Run2017{B..F}-17Nov2017
MC: RunIIFall17MiniAOD-RECOSIMstep_94X_mc2017_realistic_v10


Example 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//for root macro
#include "RoccoR.cc"
RoccoR  rc("RoccoR2017v0.txt"); 

//Or in cmssw:
#include "RoccoR.h"
RoccoR rc; 
rc.init(edm::FileInPath("path/to/RoccoR2017v0.txt").fullPath());
------
//scale factors for momentum of each muon:
double dtSF = rc.kScaleDT(Q, pt, eta, phi, s=0, m=0); //data
double mcSF = rc.kScaleFromGenMC(Q, pt, eta, phi, nl, genPt, u1, s=0, m=0); //(recommended), MC when matched gen muon is available
double mcSF = rc.kScaleAndSmearMC(Q, pt, eta, phi, nl, u1, u2, s=0, m=0); //extra smearing when matched gen muon is not available
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here: 
Q is charge
nl is trackerLayersWithMeasurement \\
u1 and u2 are random numbers distributed uniformly between 0 and 1 (gRandom->Rndm());
s is error set (default is 0)
m is error member (default is 0, ranges from 0 to nmembers-1)
For MC, when switching to different error sets/members for a given muon, u1 and u2 should remain unchanged. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Following variations are provided:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 set        nmembers	comment
Default  0	    1		default, reference based on madgraph sample, with adhoc ewk (sw2eff and Z width) and Z pt (to match data) weights. 
Stat     1          100         pre-generated stat. replicas; 
Zpt      2          1           derived without reweighting reference pt to data. 
Ewk      3          1           derived without applying ad-hoc ewk weights. 
deltaM   4          1           one representative set for alternative profile deltaM mass window 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For statistical replicas, std. dev. gives uncertainty.
For the rest, difference wrt the cental is assigned as syst. error.
Total uncertainty is calculated as the quadrature sum of the four components. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additional notes:

Normally, uncertainties are negligible compared to other uncertainties in the analysis. 
As a simple check, one can compare results with and without applying these corrections. 
If the effect on the analysis is small compared to other uncertainties, then muon calibration 
uncertainties can probably be neglected. 

Functions below return uncertainties evaluated for each muon (propagated with the procedure above):
----
double deltaDtSF = rc.kScaleDTerror(Q, pt, eta, phi);
double deltaMcSF = rc.kScaleFromGenMCerror(Q, pt, eta, phi, nl, genPt, u1);
double deltaMcSF = rc.kScaleAndSmearMCerror(Q, pt, eta, phi, nl, u1, u2);
----
Since there is no information on correlations between charges or different eta/phi bins, these functions 
are recommended to only be used as an estimate of an upper bound for uncertainty to see if it's negligible 
(to do so, scale-factors should be varied by these delta's up or down for different charges and bins in 
a most conservative way for a given analysis).
